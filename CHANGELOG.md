## v1.3.0 (2026-07-29)

### Bug Fixes (Third-Party Audit)
- **E1 (Erik Newton)**: Whitepaper §13.3 now matches verify.js — both delete only `audit.hash` (not entire `audit` object). Previously, `delete clone.audit` removed `previous_hash` and `commitment` from the JCS preimage.
- **E2 (Erik Newton)**: Chain position tampering detection restored. `audit.previous_hash` and `audit.commitment` now participate in JCS → any tampering with a record's position in the chain changes `audit.hash`.
- **E3 (Erik Newton)**: `canonical_hex` moved from vector file to separate `decision-object-answers-v1.3.json`. Conformance runners MUST NOT read the answers file — this eliminates the SHA-256-only shortcut attack.
- **S2 (Chris Hopley)**: §9.6 dual-hash transition — "verify every hash present" replaces "at least one" (CWE-757 algorithm downgrade fix).
- **S3 (Chris Hopley)**: §11.2 schema_ref SSRF hardening confirmed (offline-first, allowlisted, size-capped).
- **C3 (Chris Hopley)**: §3.3 explicitly overrides §3.1(5) for `extensions` empty array retention.
- **C2 (Chris Hopley)**: Numeric canonicalization constraint added (§3.1 constraint 8) — prevention measure for string-encoded decimal ambiguity.

### Design Changes
- All 75 DO vectors now carry full `audit` object: `hash` + `previous_hash` + `commitment`
- AV-008 (stale regression canary) replaced by AV-013 (chain position tampering canary)
- AV-013 strategy: `audit.previous_hash` in DO body tampered to point outside chain, but `audit.hash` computed with original `previous_hash`. Correct runners detect mismatch.
- Audit vector count remains 12 (AV-001~AV-012 + AV-013)

### Documentation
- Whitepaper: v1.2 DRAFT-3 → v1.3 DRAFT-4 (CN + EN)
- Runner's Guide: Step 2 deletion logic updated; Answers file section added; §5 field list corrected; §9/§10/§11 numbering fixed
- DESIGN documents: verify.js v1.2 → v1.3; generate §5 aligned; CLI docs synced to actual impl
- ALIGNMENT-REPORT: v1.3 upgrade summary

### Full-Project Audit (2026-07-29)
- Test count corrected: 153→152 (66 gen + 86 ver); "v1.2 protocol"→"v1.3 protocol" in README CN/EN
- LICENSE file added (MIT)
- §3.1(8): `priority`→`policies[].version` (removed reference to undefined Schema field)
- §4.2 #24: clarified "signature preimage = JCS preimage"

### RFC Preparation
- Regulatory 12→14: LGPD (Brazil) + DPDP (India) added to §6.1, §8, Appendix B; all references updated
- §9.4: 5 queue reliability constraints (durable writes, at-least-once, WAL, crash recovery, missing DO alert)
- §9.5: SMB minimal deployment mode (NATIVE + JSONL, 1 vCPU/512MB); progressive upgrade path (50/500 Tool Calls/s)
- §9.4: performance benchmarks (Node.js v24: ~110 µs/DO, ~8 ms/75 DO)
- Appendix C: Threat Model (STRIDE — 13 threats, 10 mitigated, 3 accepted); risk acceptance statement
- §14: expanded 8→10 RFC items
- erdl-landing SPEC v1.1: DEFER decision type added to §3.4/3.5/3.6/12.3/Appendix E (separate repo)

### Verification
- ✅ verify.js: 63/63 DO audit.hash self-consistent
- ✅ verify.js: 11/11 AV MATCH + AV-013 EXPECTED_MISMATCH (chain canary detected)
- ✅ vitest: 152/152 passed (66 generator + 86 verifier)
- ✅ CN↔EN whitepaper: cross-references aligned
- Baseline: commit `3131548` (v1.2 DRAFT-3, clean working tree)

## v1.2.0 (2026-07-28)

### Decision Vectors
- **101 vectors total** (63 static DO + 26 dynamic + 12 audit hash)
- 13 decision types fully covered: ALLOW, DENY, PASS, REQUEST_HUMAN, EMERGENCY_HALT, CORRECT, ESCALATE, NOTIFY, QUARANTINE, ROLLBACK, WORKFLOW, WORKFLOW_WAITING, WORKFLOW_PROGRESS
- 13 operators fully covered: eq, neq, gt, gte, lt, lte, in, not_in, contains, matches, starts_with, ends_with, exists
- 7 edge cases: null-propagation, strict-type-matching, ReDoS-protection, rate-limiting, integer-safe-range, object-deep-comparison, empty-extension-normalization
- DO-064 (DELEGATE) reserved for v1.3

### Architecture
- **Deterministic generation**: `generate-vectors.cjs` produces byte-identical output every run (SHA-256: `700a683d...`)
- **RFC 9562 UUIDv7**: All `decision_id`/`execution_trace_id` fully compliant (frozen timestamp `2026-07-28T00:00:00.000Z`)
- **Five-step flat hashing**: JCS (RFC 8785) → SHA-256 → audit.hash, extensions participate directly in main JCS
- **Canonical hex format**: `canonical_hex` field stores hex encoding of UTF-8 JCS bytes for cross-implementation comparison

### Verification
- **Zero-dependency verifier**: `verify.js` uses self-built JCS (no npm deps) → truly cross-implementation verifiable
- **Stale regression canary**: AV-008 intentionally mismatches — catches validators that skip five-step verification (replaced by AV-013 chain integrity canary in v1.3)
- **152 tests**: JCS RFC 8785 compliance, SHA-256 determinism, 5-step verification, tamper detection, full vector integrity (66 generator + 86 verifier as of v1.3.0)

### Security
- **Independent security review** — 0 critical/high findings
- JCS type guards: BigInt, Symbol, Date, non-plain objects all rejected with clear errors
- Input validation: verify.js validates vector file structure before processing
- Dependency pinned: `json-canonicalize` locked to `2.0.0`

### Compliance
- `erdl-compliance-v1.2` profile embedded in all vectors
- 4 regulatory frameworks: EU AI Act 2024, GB/Z 185-2026, NIST AI RMF, COSO GenAI
- HIPAA reference in DO-016 updated to include HITECH Act (2009) and 21st Century Cures Act (2016)

### Documentation
- README.md: full project overview with deterministic guarantees
- DESIGN-generate-vectors-v1.2.md: generator architecture
- DESIGN-vector-inventory-v1.2.md: full vector inventory
- DESIGN-verify-js-v1.2.md: verifier architecture
- AUDIT-REPORT.md: independent security audit
- CONTRIBUTING.md: contributor guidelines

### Breaking Changes from v1.0/v1.1
- `expected_sha256` field removed entirely — verification is now via five-step recomputation
- `canonical_bytes` renamed to `canonical_hex` for cross-implementation clarity
- `policies[].hash` is now JCS-based (previously unspecified)
- `rule_set_version.id` is JCS-based on full policy set content
- `compliance_profile` upgraded from `v1.0` → `v1.2` with 4 regulatory frameworks
- UUID format changed from v1.0/v1.1 mixed to RFC 9562 UUIDv7

### Migration from v1.1
- v1.1 vector IDs are not preserved; v1.2 is generated from scratch
- All v1.1 scenario categories are covered with improved test designs
- v1.1's technical pitfalls (T1-T10 from audit report) are all addressed in v1.2 design
